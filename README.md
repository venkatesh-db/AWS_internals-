# AWS Internals – Coderrange Edition

### 🔍 Deep Dive into AWS Services with Python Simulations

Welcome to the **AWS Internals** repository! This project offers an in-depth exploration of core AWS services by simulating their internal mechanisms using Python. It's crafted to aid learners, developers, and educators in understanding the foundational concepts of AWS without the need for actual AWS infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository emulates the internal workings of various AWS services, providing a hands-on approach to grasp their functionalities. By recreating these services in Python, users can:

* Understand the underlying principles of AWS services.
* Experiment with service behaviors in a controlled environment.
* Enhance their knowledge without incurring AWS costs.
